# XU4-TheRA-fruitbox
TheRA XU4 fruitbox

fruitbox is a customisable MP3 player for the Raspberry Pi however we are porting it to the Odroid XU4 TheRA build, allowing the user to create the look and feel of classic jukeboxes.

Installation is as follows (Installation documentation is WIP):

1. It is recommended to start from a fresh OS install (Raspbian Stretch Lite 2018-03-13 release)
2. Increase GPU memory to (at least) 256 (sudo raspi-config -> Advanced Options -> Memory Split)
3. Install fruitbox dependencies and download fruitbox and the example skins...
  
  sudo apt-get install libsm-dev libxcursor-dev libxi-dev libxinerama-dev libxrandr-dev libxpm-dev libvorbis-dev libtheora-dev
  
  git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/slappymcphee/xu4-thera-fruitbox.git
  
  cd xu4-thera-fruitbox
  
  chmod +x ./fruitbox                  (if you are using Raspbian Stretch)

  chmod +x ./fruitbox-jessie           (if you are using Raspbian Jessie)

NB: in the following instructions, if you are using Raspbian Jessie, substitute './fruitbox' for './fruitbox-jessie'...

4. Copy your music MP3 files (either to the SD card or USB memory stick)
5. Point fruitbox to your MP3 files (edit skins/WallJuke/fruitbox.cfg and/or skins/NumberOne/fruitbox.cfg and change the MusicPath parameter)
6. Run fruitbox ( ./fruitbox --cfg skins/WallJuke/fruitbox.cfg)

For best results, run fruitbox directly from a command line boot, not from a command shell launched from the desktop.

The user guide will give details on how to create your own skins, storing songs on USB memory sticks, and other helpful hints.

I have tested it using a Raspberry Pi A+ with a HifiBerry Amp+, and also a Raspberry Pi zero, and 3B, using Raspbian Stretch Lite 2017-09-07, Stretch Lite 2018-03-13 and Jessie.

Please feedback to me any bugs which need fixing, or any feature requests you would like to see in future releases.

If you design any skins and would like to share them, please let me know and I can include them in the fruitbox github
repository.
